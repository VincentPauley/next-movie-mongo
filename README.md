## TICKETS

1.

Move the movie-count chip into the AppBar so that is visible from
every page. put this next to the app title which should become a
constant.

Upon adding a new movie, make the Tanstack query run again so that
the count is reflected accurately.

2.

Make a consistent page structure with components to maintain
a consistent header or something.

3.

Create SVG files for all of the possible rating symbols and implement them into the APP.
